### Advantages of Sharing
* 읽기 및 쓰기
* 저장 용량
* 고가용성

### Sharded and Non-Shared Collections
* A database can have mixture of sharded and unsharded collections
* Sharded collections are partitioned and distributed across the shards in the cluster
* Unsharded collections are stored on a primary shard that holds all the un-sharded collections.

### Connecting to a Sharded Cluster
* You must connect to a mongos router to interact with any collections in the sharded cluster
* You can connect to a mongos via the mongo shell or a MongoDB driver

## Two Sharding Strategies for distributing data across sharded clusters
1. Ranged sharding
	* devires data into several ranges based on the shard key values
	* Each chunk is then assigned a range based on the shard key values
2. Hashed sharding
	* computing a hash of the shard key field's value
	* Each chunk is then assigned a range based on the hashed shard key values
