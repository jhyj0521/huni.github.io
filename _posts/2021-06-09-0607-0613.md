### Advantages of Sharing
* 읽기 및 쓰기
* 저장 용량
* 고가용성

### Sharded and Non-Shared Collections
* A database can have mixture of sharded and unsharded collections
* Sharded collections are partitioned and distributed across the shards in the cluster
* Unsharded collections are stored on a primary shard that holds all the un-sharded collections.

### Connecting to a Sharded Cluster
* You must connect to a mongos router to interact with any collections in the sharded cluster
* You can connect to a mongos via the mongo shell or a MongoDB driver

## Two Sharding Strategies for distributing data across sharded clusters
1. Ranged sharding
	* devires data into several ranges based on the shard key values
	* Each chunk is then assigned a range based on the shard key values
2. Hashed sharding
	* computing a hash of the shard key field's value
	* Each chunk is then assigned a range based on the hashed shard key values

## MongoDB 백업
### 백업을 위한 명령 mongodump
* dumps the entire data of your server into the dump directory
* 백업 단위 선택 가능 : 컬렉션 / 데이터베이서 / 전체 데이터베이스 단위

### 백업된 데이터의 복원 명령 mongorestore
* restores all of the data from the backup directory
* mongodump and mongorestore are not ideal for capturing backups of larger systems.

## mongodb에서 데이터 모델링
* always consider the application usage of the data as well as the inherent structure of the data itself.
* flexible schema in MongoDB
* two types of data models in MongoDB
	* embedded (de-normalized) data model
	* referenced (normalized) data model

### Embedded Relationships
* embeds all the related data in a single document, which makes it easy to retrieve and maintain
* stores the relationships between data by storing related data in a single document structure

### Referenced Relationships
* stores the relationships between data by including links or references from one document to another
* both the user and address documents will be maintained separately but the user document will contain a field that will reference the address document's id field.

## 0609
## Database References
* For many use cases in MongoDB
	* the denormalized data model where related data is stored within a single document will be optimal
	* in some cases, it makes sense to store related information in separate documents, typically in different collections or databases
* two methods for relating documents in mongoDB applications
	* manual references
	* DBRefs

### Using DBRefs
* 다음 3개의 필드를 포함하는 문서 형식으로 참조 관계를 명세해야 함
* $ref 필드 : 참조되는 문서가 속한 컬렉션 이름
* $id 필드 : 참조되는 문서의 _Id 필드
* $db 필드 : 참조되는 문서가 속한 데이터베이스 이름 (옵션)
* 필드 순서를 주의해서 사용해야 한다.
